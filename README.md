## Description 

This awesome tech blog was inspired by the MVC paradigm and to communicate among our peers. This application was created using express-session npm for authentication and Handlebars.js as the templating engine behind the views. This application follows the Model-View-Controller paradigm and structure. Sequelize was used for the ORM.
